## Metal Printing Club

At Makespace, the Metal Printing Club will build a 3D printer using the FabMX extruder, and develop a toolchain to deliver steel parts as cheaply as possible.

We'll use the FabMX extruder to print parts using a traditional FDM process:

The parts then need to be debound and sintered.

FabMX have kindly included us in their Beta Testing programme so we will have the custom metal parts needed to build the extruder.

We'll colaborate in the open here and on the Makespace Discord, as well as in-person meetings in the space.
